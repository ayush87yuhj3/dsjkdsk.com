        <h1>Top 5 <strong>Luxury Car </strong>In The World 2022</h1>
        
    <ol>
           <h1><li>Range Rover</li></h1> <br></br><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
           <p>The current, fourth-generation Range Rover is as revolutionary as any in the car’s history, with an aluminium monocoque chassis and an unashamedly luxurious agenda. Its imperious driving position, superlative luxuriousness and enduringly special cabin make it our top pick in this sub-£100,000 luxury car category.<br></p>

                That it is a luxury car first and 4x4 second is not to run down its capability offroad one jot, however. The spacious interior exudes quality and luxury, the seats are excellent and the driving position is first-rate, making it easy to drive for a car of its size. The heavy bodyshell provides excellent isolation from rough surfaces and, while it doesn’t offer the driving engagement of a Porsche Cayenne, it’s easy to make brisk progress enjoyable should the need arise; because just about any rate of progress feels special in a Range Rover.</p><h3>Price in INDIA ₹3.41 Crore</h3>

           <h1><li>Mercedes-Benz S-Class</li></h1><br></br><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
           <p>When Mercedes-Benz sets out to make a new S-Class, the brief is to make the best car in the world; simple as that. It has done on every single occasion that this defining ‘big Benz’ has been redesigned over the decades, and the last time that happened in 2020, in a more challenging and fast-changing luxury car market than the car has ever faced, Stuttgart very likely did just the same.


                This time, however, Mercedes didn’t quite hit its target right in the bullseye. What could be considered the tenth-generation S-Class risked much in a bid to level up with the digital technology of a Tesla, but to keep its recognisable high-quality feel, its opulent luxury and cabin quality and its uncompromising comfort and refinement. 
                
                It almost worked. The S-Class is still one of the most comfortable, enveloping and genteel cars in the world. But its new in-car technologies, though numerous and impressive in some ways (among them is an infotainment screen big enough to belong in the cockpit of an A380), aren’t all easy to operate; they don’t all integrate seamlessly into the car’s driving experience; and some of them feel like they’re affectations rather than enhancements. 
                
                While customers of the pricier Mercedes-Maybach S-Class get a choice of V8 and V12 powerplants, the regular limousine can be had as a -350d or -400d diesel, or as a -500 petrol - the latter also getting mild hybrid assistance. The diesels are pleasingly real-world frugal and smooth, and the S400d has all the performance that a car of this brief would ever need in any case; but the S500 offers an even quicker (and yet still suitable quiet and smooth) 400bhp+ option should you want it.</p> <h3>Price in INDIA ₹1.62 Crore</h3>

           <h1><li>Audi E-tron Quattro</li></h1><br></br><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
           <p>We’re now entering reasonably well-established times for the premium electric car. There have been fast ones, very fast ones, big ones, small ones, expensive ones and cheap, and some that even attempt a bit of four-wheel driven versatility. 

                    But never has an electric car come along and done onboard luxury better than Audi’s first stab at the zero-emissions template: the E-tron Quattro. This car combines four-wheel drive and a commanding outright performance level with SUV-typical space, convenience and usability, and also with Audi brand desirability. But what really makes it stand out is how superbly hushed, comfortable and refined it is. When we road tested one, our decibel placed its cabin noise level closer, at a 70mph cruise, to that of a Rolls-Royce Phantom than a Tesla Model X.</p><h3>Price in INDIA ₹2 Crore</h3>

           <h1><li>Audi A8</li></h1><br></br><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
           <p>The latest Audi A8 features some of the most advanced chassis, powertrain and in-car technology in the luxury class including, when it’s finally switched on, what promises to be the greatest capability for autonomous driving of any production car in the world. The car represents Audi doing classic ‘vorsprung durch technik’ in a properly committed way.

            There’s a choice of turbocharged engines – a 282bhp diesel or 335bhp petrol – with four-wheel-drive as standard and a 48V electrical system that gives it mild hybrid status. Higher up the model range you'll find the tax-saving six-cylinder petrol 60 TFSIe, whose refinement and effortless responsiveness really boost the appeal of the car's driving experience - as well as the range-topping V8-powered S8 executive express.
            
            The A8's quality interior feels like it was built to outlast civilization itself, although it lacks the sense of occasion of the class-leading Range Rover. The ride is smooth and the car is easy to drive, although it's not quite as pillowy and luxurious as its key German rival, and not quite the Mercedes' equal in the ways that matter most.

            <h1><li>Mercedes CLS </li></h1><br></br><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>Whether Mercedes invented the modern hybrid vehicle bodystyle that, for a while, was amusingly dubbed the ‘coupoon’ (a four-door saloon crossbred with a more tapered silhouette and a swooping coupé-like roofline) or whether it was Maserati with the fifth-generation Quattroporte is a matter of contention. Either way, it’s fair to record that the original Mercedes CLS of 2004 was one of the originators of what still seems a fairly new vehicle type; also, that that vehicle type has become an important part of the modern luxury-car landscape; and that Mercedes has probably done more than any other car maker to popularise it.

                Now in its third model generation, the CLS has always proved significantly better than most 2+2s for practicality, hitting a high point for it with the Shooting Brake version – a favourite CLS derivative at Autocar Towers that Mercedes regrettably decided would be discontinued with the current third-generation version of the car.
                
                The CLS has never looked better than in its first trend-setting model generation, but the slightly awkward looks of the second-generation version are now behind it, and the car’s technology-packaged, leather-bound cabin has never been more inviting than it is today.
                
                The engine range includes both four- and six-cylinder turbocharged petrols and a couple of six-cylinder turbo diesels, with the four-wheel-drive CLS 53 performance hybrid having replaced the firebreathing V8-powered old CLS 63 at the top of the pile, and bringing an appealing different flavour to the AMG armoury. The chassis juggles involvement against isolation well – although bigger-rimmed versions fitted with run-flat tyres can suffer from iffy rolling refinement and are certainly worth a test drive before purchase.</p><h3>Price in INDIA ₹1Crore</h3>
